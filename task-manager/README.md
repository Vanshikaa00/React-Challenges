## 🧠 Challenge: **Task Manager with Confirmation Dialog**

### 📝 Goal:

Build a **task manager app** where users can:

* Add tasks with a title and due date
* View the list of tasks
* Delete a task using a **confirmation modal** (using `useRef`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`)
* Maintain and share state between components (using `useState`, lifting state up)
* Pass props through intermediate components (forwarding props)
* 
---

### 🧪 Bonus Objectives:

* Forward props through a **wrapper component** (e.g., `TaskItemWrapper`) to practice `forwarding props`.
* Add validation for empty input.
* Disable “Save” button unless fields are filled.

---

### 🚀 Sample UI Flow:

1. User types a task and due date.
2. Clicks **"Add Task"** → task is added to the list.
3. User clicks **"Delete"** → confirmation modal appears.
4. User confirms → task is deleted from the list.
