Absolutely! Here's a **hands-on React challenge** that will help you practice all the concepts you mentioned:

## 🧠 Challenge: **Task Manager with Confirmation Dialog**

### 📝 Goal:

Build a **task manager app** where users can:

* Add tasks with a title and due date
* View the list of tasks
* Delete a task using a **confirmation modal** (using `useRef`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`)
* Maintain and share state between components (using `useState`, lifting state up)
* Pass props through intermediate components (forwarding props)

---

### 🔧 Requirements:

#### 1. **App Component**:

* Holds the **global task list state**.
* Renders:

  * `TaskForm`
  * `TaskList`
  * `ConfirmDialog`

#### 2. **TaskForm Component**:

* Inputs for task title and due date
* Uses `useState` to manage form inputs
* On submit, calls a prop function (`onAddTask`) to lift the new task up to `App`

#### 3. **TaskList Component**:

* Receives the task list via props
* Maps through tasks and renders each with a **Delete** button
* Passes task info to `ConfirmDialog` via the `App` state (lift the selected task to App)

#### 4. **ConfirmDialog Component**:

* Created using `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle`
* Uses `<dialog>` element (HTML5 native)
* Provides `open()` method via ref
* On confirmation, calls `onConfirm(taskId)` passed via props
* Use `useRef` to manage dialog DOM access

---

### 🧪 Bonus Objectives:

* Forward props through a **wrapper component** (e.g., `TaskItemWrapper`) to practice `forwarding props`.
* Add validation for empty input.
* Disable “Save” button unless fields are filled.

### 🧱 Suggested File Structure:

```
src/
├── App.jsx
├── components/
│   ├── TaskForm.jsx
│   ├── TaskList.jsx
│   ├── ConfirmDialog.jsx
│   ├── TaskItemWrapper.jsx (optional)
```

---

### 🚀 Sample UI Flow:

1. User types a task and due date.
2. Clicks **"Add Task"** → task is added to the list.
3. User clicks **"Delete"** → confirmation modal appears.
4. User confirms → task is deleted from the list.

### 🧠 Concepts You'll Practice:

| Concept               | Where It's Used                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`            | Managing form input and task list                 |
| `useRef`              | Referencing the dialog element                    |
| `forwardRef`          | Creating a reusable confirmation dialog component |
| `useImperativeHandle` | Exposing `open()` from the dialog                 |
| Lifting State Up      | Sharing tasks between `TaskForm` and `TaskList`   |
| Forwarding Props      | Via optional wrapper or deeply nested component   |

Would you like a **starter template** to begin this challenge, or would you prefer building it from scratch?
